# Joe Roberts - Skills

I have made this to keep a log of what skills I am working towards, have demonstrated and generally keep a record so I can point to when people ask me. This is based upon Skills Framework for the Information Age, the particular competencies provided by Made Tech.

I will keep a log of all my objectives, evidence and what is done toward the skills here. The hope is this will be more indepth that the spreadsheet that I've been using so far and much more personal. :) Also I'm a collassal nerd.

## What are the skills?

Each category will have its own page, the skills can be broken down into five broad categories:

- Autonomy
- Influence
- Complexity
- Knowledge
- Business Skills

Each category has 2-5 different competencies on it. The idea is I should be working towards them as part of my career progression and that demonstrating all of them will move to the next level of SFIA. (It feels so regimented, but it's got some big names behind it so it must be good!)
