# Autonomy

## Works under general direction

- As part of my day-to-day work, I generally work autonomously on issues, taking information given and working out the best task/effort required to resolve.

## Uses discretion in identifying and responding to complex issues and assignments. 

- I will often take a broad strokes or high level ticket with acceptance criteria and break it down into individual tasks. This is helpful in making complex issues easier to deal with.

## Receives specific direction, accepts guidance and has work reviewed at agreed milestones. 

- When I am working on a piece of work, I will meet with stakeholders to discuss the progress and ensure that the work is progressing in the correct direction. This often includes designers to ensure that the work is matched to the design.

## Determines when issues should be escalated to a higher level.

- I will bring issues that I have to higher levels, be that a senior/lead engineer, delivery manager or service owner. This is especially true at the point I discover I am blocked on something, so that the blockage can be resolved as quickly as possible.
