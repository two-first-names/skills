# Knowledge

## Has a sound generic, domain and specialist knowledge necessary to perform effectively in the organisation typically gained from recognised bodies of knowledge and organisational information. 

- I bring a wealth of knowledge on a variety of topics to my role, not limited to:
  - I am capable of quickly learning new systems and languages.
  - I have knowledge of multiple cloud providers.
  - Agile practices in general.

## Demonstrates effective application of knowledge. 

- I will bring knowledge that I have into what I am working on. For example:
  - In Skills For Care, I brought my previous experience in DevOps onto the project to propose multiple solutions to better orchestrate the project.
  - On NHS Jobs, I brought a wealth of AWS knowledge to build a reporting system using AWS tools.

## Has an appreciation of the wider business context. 

- When I am working on a task, I will take a step back and think about the impact. Often this is on compliance (GDS, GDPR for example), accessibility or financial. Whenever I am in doubt on something, I will ask and use it as an oppurtunity to get more insight into the business.

## Takes action to develop own knowledge.

- I am constantly pushing myself to learn new things. Both during time I have during work hours and outside of work, I will be constantly refining my skills and learning new best practices.
