# Influence

## Interacts with and influences colleagues.

- I have been part of the Diversity and Inclusion Working Group at Made Tech since its inception. More recently, I have taken on the role of leading the group and advocating the interests to the wider business, working alongside the Head of People and working with leadership. 

## Has working level contact with customers, suppliers and partners.

- As part of my work on Diversity and Inclusion, I have been approched by Difrent to talk about our strategy and collaborate. I am hopeful this will lead to both organisations benefitting.

- At KPMG, I have worked alongside Account Managers at AWS, Azure and Datadog to deliver solutions. I have a good working knowledge of working with suppliers and  leveraging that relationship to help build a product.

- Working with Skills For Care, I worked alongside the customer to deliver a product. I had contact with both the customer technical lead and the service owner, getting an insight into how to negotiate and traverse issues with customers.

- Working with NHSBSA, I have worked with the Solutions Architect for NHSBSA on designing and implementing a reporting service. I have used this relationship to get a better insight into the service and the wider context at the BSA.

## May supervise others or make decisions which impact the work assigned to individuals or phases of projects.

- While at KPMG, I acted in the role of technical lead on three seperate projects. In this role, I coordinated workloads and supervised other engineers to develop a product.

- As part of my work with Skills For Care, I worked on a spike to investigate observability solutions. The findings of this directly built onto more work and a bigger workload to implement the systems.

- At NHSBSA, I worked on a spike for building a reporting and business intelligence platform. I had a great degree of autonomy and decision making power in this, this influenced further work.

## Understands and collaborates on the analysis of user/customer needs and represents this in their work.

- I always take into account customers needs and include them in any decisions I make. I take care to kick off any features I work on with them and keep them in the loop with any issues they are stakeholders in.

- User-centric services are at the core of what we do, so is user research. I make efforts to be involved in user research, observing and note taking. I will also involve user research in technical decisions.
